### My First Repo with HNGi7

#### HNGi7 Started 1st of June 2020


The HNG internship is a 3-month remote internship designed to find and develop the most talented software developers.
Everyone is welcome to participate (there is no entrance exam). Anyone can log into the internship using their laptop. Each week, we give tasks. Those who complete them advance forward. We pay the interns weekly.
The intern coders are introduced to complex programming frameworks, and get to work on real world software. The finalists are connected to the best companies in the tech ecosystem and get full time jobs and contracts immediately.

The interns are given tasks that are more focused with real world experiences.
